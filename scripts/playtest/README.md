# Manual playtest scripts

Scripted playthroughs of the game in headless Chromium. They are run by hand
only. They are not part of `npm run check` or CI, and nothing here is a test
that gates a merge.

A script plays with key presses (plus one mouse click on the end screen) and
reads the live game state after each action to check the result. It reports
findings (a wrong price, a failed hand-in, bad crop growth) and any console
errors. The game's weather and forage are random, so reruns differ.

## Run

1. Once per Playwright version: `npx playwright install chromium`.
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`. The scripts need the dev build, because
   they use `window.farmDebug`.
3. In another terminal: `npm run playtest -- expert` (or `intermediate`, or
   `casual`). A full run takes 10 to 20 minutes.
4. `npm run playtest:late` leaves a new game standing until 2 am and checks the
   pass-out. It takes about 14 minutes.

5. `npm run playtest:touch` plays one short loop with touch events only, in a
   tablet-sized touch browser (1200x700 CSS pixels, like the SM-T500): the
   stick, the toolbar, till, plant, water and harvest, a second finger on Use
   while the stick is held, hold Use to chop a tree and its stump, ground goods picked up by walking, the
   shop, the hall, the bed in the house, the report and Continue on the title
   screen. It also checks touch target sizes. About 85 seconds.

6. `npm run playtest:controls` checks the input profiles (note 45): a mouse drag
   does not move the player on desktop, the keyboard does not on touch, and a
   rebound key works. About 20 seconds.

7. `node scripts/playtest/bin.mjs` ships, takes back, ships part through the
   prompt, sleeps, and checks the payout, summary and report. About 10 seconds.

8. `node scripts/playtest/wood.mjs` plays a chopper: it fells the starting trees
   with a held key, sleeps when the energy is low, and reports the days, energy
   and wood to reach 450 wood (`WOOD_TARGET` changes it). About 3 minutes.

Dev hooks the scripts can call: `window.farmGive(id, n)` adds items (returns
`"ok"`, `"unknown"` or `"full"`), `window.farmMoney(n)` adds money. By hand, the
debug menu (`docs/design/42_debug_menu.md`) opens with the backtick key or the
DBG button. Both exist in dev builds only.

Screenshots and saves go to `playtest-out/` (git-ignored).

Settings, as environment variables:

- `BASE_URL`: the dev server, default `http://localhost:5173/`.
- `CHROMIUM_PATH`: use this browser instead of the one Playwright installed.
- `DEVICE_CDP`: drive Chrome on a real Android tablet instead of a headless
  browser. Connect it with USB debugging, then run
  `adb reverse tcp:5173 tcp:5173`, open `http://localhost:5173/` in Chrome on
  it, and `adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:chrome_devtools_remote`. Set
  `DEVICE_CDP=http://localhost:9222`. Close other game tabs on the device
  first. Works for `npm run playtest:touch`.
- `PROFESSION`: `1` (default) or `2`, the key pressed when a skill reaches level 5
  and the profession scene opens.
- `MAX_DAY`: stop after this day, default 84 (the calendar wraps into year 2).
- `SEED`: a number that makes `Math.random` repeatable in the browser, so two
  builds see the same weather, forage and trees. Timing still varies, so runs
  are close, not identical. Compare final counts only: findings pile up on the
  last day, so a count read mid run says little. To compare a branch with
  `main`, check `main` out in a second worktree, run its dev server on another
  port, and point `BASE_URL` at it.

The three runs can go at the same time against one dev server. Each persona
writes its own `save-<persona>.json` and `<persona>-*.png` files, so they do not
collide. This was checked on 2026-10-31 on the owner's machine (48 cores): all
three ran together and the in-game results were unaffected, only real time was
longer. Not checked: running `playtest:touch` or `playtest:late` alongside them.

To run them in parallel from a shell, send each to a log and a done marker, then
read the logs when the markers exist:

```bash
for p in expert intermediate casual; do
  nohup bash -c "npm run playtest -- $p > /tmp/pt-$p.log 2>&1; touch /tmp/pt-$p.done" &
done
```

Read `FINDINGS:` at the end of each log. Expect about 10 to 30 minutes each.

A run of "no stand tile for x,y" script errors means the bot used the wrong map,
not that the game is broken. `useAt` and `walkTo` plan on the map the bot is on,
so read it from the game first (`here = d.map` in `lib.mjs`). This bit after the
hall became a walkable map.

## Personas

- `expert`: knows every bundle, plants each bundle crop on day 1, forages every
  day. The fastest path.
- `intermediate`: knows the bundles, farms a small patch, forages on most days,
  batches shop and hall trips, sometimes forgets to water.
- `casual`: plays about 3 days in 4, sells everything it picks, forgets to
  water, and once works until the energy runs out. Deliberately harsh: a check
  on the floor.

Results from the first runs are in `docs/design/08_playtest_personas.md`. Rerun
all three after a change to prices, bundles, growth or energy.

## Files

- `lib.mjs`: browser launch, pathfinding walk, facing and tool use. It also
  answers the profession scene (key 1, or `PROFESSION=2`) after a use key (C) press.
- `play.mjs`: the daily routine and the personas.
- `late.mjs`: the stay-up-late test.
- `wood.mjs`: the wood persona.
- `touch.mjs`: the touch persona. It uses the Chrome DevTools protocol to send
  real multi-touch events. It is an emulator: it cannot judge how the targets
  feel under a finger, the frame rate, or Android Chrome's own behaviour.

The farm layout in `play.mjs` (soil rows at y 11 and 13, aisle at y 12) and the
door tile in `lib.mjs` match `src/content/maps/farm.json`. Update them if the
map changes.
