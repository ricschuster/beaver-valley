# 65 Special Orders and seasonal debris (draft)

Status: draft, 2026-11-06. The four forks below were decided with the owner.
The order list, counts, rewards and debris numbers are the assistant's
proposal, and every number is a placeholder. Nothing here is built. It settles
the Special Orders that note 57 reserved (SC-32) and the clutter that returns
each season (SC-29, note 55). Stardew's saved Quests page was read as
reference only, and its order list is not copied (ADR 0002): our orders have
our own names, posters and items.

## Decided with the owner (2026-11-06)

1. **The board opens on a fixed day, as Stardew.** A short scene on Fall 2 of
   year one, in any weather, opens it (checked, SC-32). Each order has its own
   prerequisite (a system built, a season), so a player only sees orders they
   can fill. No order needs the hall.
2. **The clock starts when you accept.** Each order has a fixed window of 7 to
   28 days from acceptance. Waiting never shortens it. Stardew runs the clock
   from posting (checked), so this is ours, chosen for the no pressure tone.
3. **Debris returns each season, in small amounts (Stardew, from memory).**
   Rocks and twigs return on the farm at season start, with a cap. Nothing
   returns in winter. Numbers below.
4. **First time pays a unique reward, repeats pay gold (Stardew).** Our own
   recipes, machines, hats and scenes. Prize Tickets stay out until a prize
   list exists (note 50, "For later").

## Special Orders

- **Where.** The Outpost wall, beside road news (note 57). Orders use the note
  50 quest record with `source: special`. Posters are travellers and carriers,
  not villagers, as note 57 says.
- **Pace (as Stardew, checked).** One new order is posted each week, on the
  first day of the week. A player may accept one new order a week, and may have
  several active at once. The owner recalls two on the board at once (SC-32,
  unchecked), so the board shows two and a posted order stays until taken or
  replaced.
- **Hand-in.** An order fills itself, with no talking to the poster, as in
  Stardew. Where it asks for goods in a place (a pantry, a bin), the goods must
  come from after acceptance, so an order cannot be filled from a full chest.
- **Failing.** Letting the window run out costs nothing. The order can be
  offered again, and goods already put in are returned by mail.
- **Cancel.** Unlike Stardew, an accepted order can be dropped from the journal,
  since a lapse costs nothing anyway.
- **Rewards.** First completion: a unique reward (recipe, machine, hat or scene)
  plus gold. Later completions of a repeatable order pay gold only. Orders that
  mark "no repeat" show a tick once done.
- **Counts toward** the Help Wanted achievements, as in Stardew (notes 38, 50).

### First draft of orders

Our own names and numbers. The "needs" column is the slice that makes the order
possible (`33_build_order.md`). Gold is a placeholder, set when tuning.

| Order | Ask | Window | Needs | First reward | Repeat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bumper Harvest | Harvest then ship 100 of one crop in season (not winter) | 28 days | Slice 1 | A second shipping bin | Yes |
| Spring Leeks | Leave 12 leeks at a named house, spring only | 28 days | Slice 1 | A recipe and a scene | No |
| Fine Vegetables | Ship 25 gold quality vegetables to the store bin | 28 days | Slice 1 | A recipe | Yes |
| Barrel Batch | Put 12 of one keg drink in a named kitchen | 14 days | Slice 1 (keg) | A recipe and a scene | No |
| Too Many Fish | Catch 10 of one in season fish | 7 days | Slice 2 | A recipe | Yes |
| Still Waters | Catch 20 fish of one water type | 7 days | Slice 2 | A machine | Yes |
| Clean Waters | Fish or collect 20 trash items, then bin them | 7 days | Slice 2 | A recipe and a scene | No |
| Cave Patrol | Slay 50 of one cave creature | 7 days | Slice 3 | A recipe | Yes |
| Crystal Gift | Hand over one of each of five gems | 7 days | Slice 3 | A machine and a scene | No |
| Pantry Stock | Put 24 eggs in the inn pantry | 14 days | Slice 4 | A machine | Yes |

- Stardew's board also has bone, island and later orders. Ours leave out the
  island (ring 2 has its own board, note 39) and the museum order until the
  gallery exists. More orders are a data change.
- Orders that need a system not yet built are simply not drawn. The draw is
  seeded from the week, so a reload gives the same board (as note 50).
- Quest record: add `special` to the `source` values, and fields for the
  window in days, whether it repeats and whether it was done before.

## Seasonal debris

Settles SC-29 and the open clutter rule in note 55. The farm only, as weeds
are (note 29). All numbers are placeholders.

- **When.** On day 1 of spring, summer and fall. Nothing returns on winter day
  1, and winter day 1 clears weeds as note 29 says.
- **What.** Up to 8 rocks and 8 twigs appear on free tillable tiles, and a 10
  percent chance of one stump a season. There is a standing cap of 25 rocks and
  25 twigs on the farm, so a skipped season does not bury it.
- **Where not.** Never on tilled soil, crops, paths, placed objects, furniture
  or the 3 by 3 around a fruit tree. Debris only takes free tiles, as weeds do.
- **Spread.** Trees keep the rule in note 36. Grass spreads slowly onto free
  adjacent tiles outside winter. The grass rate is open (no grass system yet).
- **Drops.** Unchanged from the clearing rules (stone from rocks, wood from
  twigs and stumps).
- **Wood and stone economy.** Returning debris adds a steady wood and stone
  supply, and note 55 already says the wood economy needs a second look. Check
  both in play.

## Build order

1. The quest record change and the Special Orders draw, with tests.
2. The board on the Outpost wall and the Fall 2 scene (needs the Outpost,
   note 57 build order step 5).
3. Orders one at a time, as their systems arrive.
4. Seasonal debris with the weeds work (`29_weeds.md`, slice 1 build 3).

## Still open

- The real list: more orders, final gold, the first rewards and their scenes.
- The chance a week has an order, and what the board shows if none can be drawn.
- Whether the board shows two orders or a different number (SC-32).
- The grass spread rate and whether grass exists as a tile before slice 1.
- Whether an order's goods can be returned in full if the window lapses.
