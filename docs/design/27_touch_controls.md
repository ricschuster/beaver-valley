# 27 Touch controls (draft)

Status: draft, open questions settled. Decided with the owner on 2026-10-31. Nothing here is built
except the floating stick (`src/scenes/controls.ts`). Reference: the Stardew
Valley Wiki Mobile Controls and Controls pages, read only (ADR 0002).

## Decisions

- Default on a tablet is tap-to-move, as in Stardew. Tap a spot and the farmer
  walks there. Holding a finger down makes the farmer follow it.
- Tapping an object walks to it and acts on it, picking the right tool for the
  job (pickaxe for a rock, axe for a tree). The scythe, seeds and food stay
  manual picks from the toolbar, as in Stardew.
- A second scheme is a floating stick on the left half with a use-tool button
  (hold to repeat) and an action button on the right. The stick we have now is
  the base for it.
- The player switches scheme in options. Two schemes only.
- Keyboard and mouse on desktop are a separate profile and are not mixed with
  touch. See `45_controls_profiles.md`.

## Why two schemes

Stardew's own page says tap-to-move is too imprecise for careful placement, so
it points players to a stick scheme for those jobs. Tilling a tight plot and
placing objects are our careful jobs, so the stick scheme must stay one tap
away in options.

## Settled on 2026-10-31

- **Pathfinding:** tap-to-move finds a route around rocks, trees, water and
  fences on the tile grid (A* on the collision map). The target is highlighted
  red only when no route exists, and the farmer does not move. Stardew also
  highlights a blocked target in red, but its routing stalls on moving NPCs and
  animals; ours re-plans when a moving body blocks the route and gives up
  after a short wait instead of wandering.
- **Edge taps:** the toolbar takes taps only on a slot, with a dead margin round
  the bar. A world tap in the margin along the screen edge walks the farmer and
  never touches the toolbar. Stardew only warns players to take care near the
  edges, so this is a fix where it has none.
- **Layout:** the toolbar sits along the bottom in both schemes, so there is one
  position to learn. In the stick scheme the use-tool and action buttons sit
  above the right end of the bar. When food is selected an Eat button appears
  beside the toolbar (tap-to-move scheme) or takes the action button's place
  (stick scheme).

## Open questions

- Checked on a real tablet (#59, #63) before either scheme is called done. The
  dead margin width, the Eat button size and the give-up wait are placeholders
  until then.
