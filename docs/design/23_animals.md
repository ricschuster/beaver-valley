# 23 Animals

Status: **decided with the owner on 2026-10-30**, in two rounds of questions.
The species, buildings and professions are settled. The numbers under "Placeholder
numbers" are our draft and are listed under "Open". Every number is a
placeholder. Nothing here is built. Stardew facts
were checked against the Stardew Valley Wiki "Animals" page on 2026-10-30.

## Why

Bundles 11, 25 and 27 already assume animal goods and a coop, and the loom, the
cheese press and the dyer need wool and milk (`16_bundles.md`). The neglect rule
is written (`09_story_and_lore.md`). The animals' farmstead and its keeper sit in
the Forest (`19_valley_layout.md`, `20_ring1_cast.md`). This note settles the
animals before any code, so they do not feel bolted on.

## Decided with the owner (2026-10-30)

- **Exception, the Meadow farm.** It starts with a built coop and two chickens,
  skipping the carpenter and keeper for the first coop only
  (`32_farm_types.md`).
- **Buildings stand on the home farm.** A coop and a barn, each upgradable, and
  an upgrade never changes the building's footprint (`41_house.md`). A
  carpenter in Hearthwell builds and upgrades them (an existing cast member,
  see "Cast"). The Forest farmstead keeper sells animals and gives advice.
- **Care is Stardew-like:** feed, pet, let out.
- **Products come on a timer per species.** Auto-collect can come later, not in
  the first build.
- **Hay comes from grass and a silo.** No treats: grain and root crops do not
  raise mood. Bundle 25 (Fodder) stays as written, because its items are goods
  to hand in, not feed.
- **Winter needs the coop heater to keep mood up,** as in Stardew. The heater is
  the bundle 25 reward.
- **A spouse feeds hay only.** You still pet, let out and collect.
- **Animal professions follow Stardew's tree** (see "Professions").
- **No animal of our own in the first build.** The slot is left for the art
  pass (#58).
- **Animals are bought young and grow up, and an incubator hatches eggs.** Same
  system as Stardew.
- **Animals are named by the player and show a heart meter.**
- **Left outside at night, an animal sleeps outside.** The door stays shut. It
  costs mood and the next day's product, nothing else. It costs no friendship.
  No animal is ever lost or hurt.

## What Stardew has (checked against the wiki, 2026-10-30)

| Building | Animals | Products |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coop, 3 tiers | Chicken, duck, rabbit, plus incubated void chicken, dinosaur, golden chicken | Egg daily, duck egg every 2 days, wool every 4 days |
| Barn, 3 tiers | Cow, goat, sheep, pig | Milk, goat milk, wool every 3 days, truffles on clear non-winter days |

- Friendship runs 0 to 1000 (5 hearts). Petting is +15, milking or shearing +5,
  outdoor grass +8. At day end, not fed is -20, trapped outside is -20, and not
  petted is -5 to -10. Mood runs 0 to 255.
- Mood: petting +32 to +36, outdoor grass sets it to 255, not fed -100, not
  petted -20 to -40, slept outside halves it. Rain and winter outdoors, and
  outdoors after 7pm, drain it.
- A fed animal with under 70 mood may make nothing (chance is mood / 70). Quality
  and large products need 150 mood or more, with some chance below that.
- Quality score is friendship / 1000 - (1 - mood / 225). Large products need 200
  friendship. Duck feathers and rabbit's feet also use daily luck.
- Sheep regrow wool every 3rd day, fed and at 70 mood or more, and every 2nd day
  at 900 friendship. Pigs find truffles only when let outdoors, so none in winter
  or rain.
- Hay goes on a bench, with a silo behind it and an auto-feeder at the deluxe
  tier. Animals prefer fresh grass, and stay in when it is winter or wet. Newly
  arrived animals need no feeding on the first day, and babies who go unfed do
  not grow.
- Stardew loses an animal only when it is trapped outside with the doors closed,
  and then only on a random night event. We do not copy that.
- Stardew also has ostriches, golden animal crackers and optional pregnancy for
  barn animals. We take none of them for now.

## Animals

Seven species, in two buildings. Prices and days are placeholders.

| Animal | Building | Product | Days between |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chicken | Coop | Egg | 1 |
| Duck | Big coop | Duck egg, feather at high friendship | 2 |
| Rabbit | Deluxe coop | Wool | 4 |
| Cow | Big barn | Milk | 1 |
| Goat | Big barn | Goat milk | 2 |
| Sheep | Deluxe barn | Wool | 3 |
| Pig | Deluxe barn | Truffle, when let out (not winter or rain) | 1 |

- **Cut:** void chicken, dinosaur and golden chicken. They are secret finds and
  belong with the completion tracker (#196).
- **Why these:** eggs feed bundle 11, milk feeds the cheese press, wool feeds the
  loom and dyer (bundle 23), and truffles need a processing machine for the
  processing note.
- **A valley animal of our own** is wanted for the setting's own character. It is
  optional and not designed here.

## Buildings

- **Coop and barn, three tiers each**, after Stardew: base, big, deluxe. Each tier
  raises capacity and unlocks more species. The deluxe tier adds an auto-feeder.
- Capacity per tier, prices and build times go in `07_tuning_numbers.md`.
- The incubator comes with the big coop.
- Building runs through the keeper or the carpenter. Who builds is open.

## Care loop

Daily, in the morning and evening:

1. **Feed.** Hay goes on the bench. Grass-fed hay fills the silo.
2. **Pet.** Petting adds friendship and mood.
3. **Let out.** An animal outside on grass on a clear day eats free and gains
   mood.
4. **Bring in, close up.** The evening choice. An animal left out sleeps out.

Neglect follows the written rule:

- Unfed animals make nothing that day.
- Unpetted animals lose a little friendship and mood. Left-out animals lose mood
  only. Both lower product quality.
- Nothing is removed, nobody scolds, nobody gets angry. Animals cope with a few
  days of absence (`01_system_map.md`).

## Products and quality

- Each species has its own timer. Quality tiers follow friendship and mood and
  reuse the existing quality system.
- High friendship and mood give a chance of a large or rare product, such as the
  duck feather.
- The first build collects by hand. Auto-collect is a later upgrade.

## Feed and the silo

- Cutting grass with the scythe fills the silo with hay. The keeper sells hay as a
  backstop.
- The silo holds hay for winter and rain, when there is little grass.
- No treats. Grain and root crops are not feed. Bundle 25 uses them only as goods.

## Young animals and the incubator

- Young animals are bought from the keeper, and grow into adults in a few days.
  They make nothing until grown.
- Eggs hatch in the incubator, as in Stardew (about six days there).
- Animals do not breed on their own.

## Names and hearts

- The player names each animal when it arrives.
- Friendship shows as hearts, up to five. The meter shows only on the animal's
  own card, not in the main interface.
- A few lines per species in the voice sheet style are possible later, not
  settled here.

## Professions

Decided with the owner: Stardew's tree. Checked against the Stardew Valley Wiki
"Skills" page (saved by the owner on 2026-10-30).

- **Level 5, farming:** Rancher (animal goods sell for 20 percent more) or Tiller
  (crops sell for 10 percent more). Agriculturist moves to level 10.
- **Level 10, under Rancher:** Coopmaster (befriend coop animals faster, coop
  goods are better quality, the incubator takes half the time) or Shepherd
  (befriend barn animals faster, barn goods are better quality, sheep regrow
  wool a day sooner).
- **Level 10, under Tiller:** Artisan (artisan goods sell for 40 percent more) or
  Agriculturist (crops grow 10 percent faster).
- This needs a level 10 choice, which `professions.ts` does not have yet. Today
  the farming choice is Tiller or Agriculturist at level 5, so building this
  changes that file, its tests and the skills screen. Artisan needs the
  processing note.

## Cast

The carpenter is already on the cast list (`20_ring1_cast.md`, the carpenter
household, deep tier, runs the sawmill). The carpenter now also builds and
upgrades the coop and barn. The farmstead keeper sells animals, hay and the
incubator eggs. No new cast slot is needed.

## Placeholder numbers

Our draft, to be tuned in playtests and copied into `07_tuning_numbers.md`.

| Building | Tier | Holds | Opens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coop | Coop | 4 | Chicken |
| Coop | Big coop | 8 | Duck, incubator |
| Coop | Deluxe coop | 12 | Rabbit, auto-feeder |
| Barn | Barn | 4 | Cow |
| Barn | Big barn | 8 | Goat |
| Barn | Deluxe barn | 12 | Sheep, pig, auto-feeder |

- Each tier costs money and wood and stone, and takes a few days to build. Prices
  start near Stardew's and are rebalanced to our economy: coop 4000g, big coop
  10000g, deluxe coop 20000g, with the same for the barn. Animals cost 800g
  (chicken) to 16000g (pig), as in the table above.
- Tiers open with money and materials only. No hall gating yet.
- The keeper sells whichever species the owned building can hold, so each tier
  opens its animals.
- Young animals grow up in about 4 to 5 days. The incubator hatches in about 6.

## Open

- Prices, wood and stone costs, build times and the grow-up days are
  placeholders to rebalance. Animal prices need checking against bundle rewards
  (`16_bundles.md`, "Open questions", issue #201).
- Whether the carpenter also builds other things (the silo, the stable, a fish
  pond).
- The level 10 tier of professions: the choice screen, the file change, and how
  it ties to the processing note for Artisan.
- Whether pigs also need rain and winter rules beyond "let out" in the code.
- Whether the keeper or the carpenter sells the silo.
- A valley animal of our own, with the art pass (#58).
- Whether hall gating belongs on the deluxe tiers.
