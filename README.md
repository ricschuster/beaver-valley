# Beaver Valley

Beaver Valley is a working title; the name is still a placeholder (see
`docs/design/00_project_brief.md`).

A cozy farming-life game with its own setting, played in the browser and on
tablets. The player farms, forages and hands goods in to the village hall to
finish a chain of community projects. It is a free hobby project by a solo
developer, inspired by Stardew Valley but not copied from it (see
`docs/decisions/0002-stardew-valley-inspired.md`).

## Status

The first playable (milestone M2) works in the browser with placeholder art.
The roadmap is `docs/design/03_milestones.md`, and GitHub issues are the live
tracker.

## Running it

Needs Node 22 and npm.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the address Vite prints. Move with arrows or WASD, or drag on a touch
screen. `npm run check` runs every CI gate (format, lint, typecheck, tests and
build). `CLAUDE.md` lists all the commands.

## Where things are

- `src/core/`: game rules, free of Phaser and the DOM, unit tested.
- `src/content/`: data files (crops, forage, bundles, maps).
- `src/scenes/`: Phaser scenes and the on-screen interface.
- `docs/`: design notes, decision records and session handoffs.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
